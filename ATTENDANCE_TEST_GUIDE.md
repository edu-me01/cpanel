# Attendance System Test Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to test the attendance system to ensure it works correctly when the admin opens/closes attendance and students can/cannot mark their attendance accordingly.

## Test Files Created
1. `test-data.html` - Sets up test data (admin and student accounts)

## Testing the Full System

### Using the Main Application

#### Admin Side (index.html):
1. **Setup Test Data:**
   - Open `test-data.html`
   - Click "Setup Test Data" button
   - This creates admin@test.com (admin123) and student@test.com (student123)

2. **Login as Admin:**
   - Go to `index.html`
   - Login with admin@test.com / admin123
   - Navigate to Attendance section

3. **Test Open/Close:**
   - Click "Open Attendance" - status should show "Open"
   - Click "Close Attendance" - status should show "Closed"

#### Student Side (student-dashboard.html):
1. **Login as Student:**
   - Go to `student-dashboard.html`
   - Login with student@test.com / student123

2. **Test Attendance Tab:**
   - Click on "Attendance" tab
   - When attendance is OPEN:
     - Should see "Attendance Status: Open" (green badge)
     - Should see attendance form with Present/Late/Absent buttons
     - Can mark attendance
   - When attendance is CLOSED:
     - Should see "Attendance Status: Closed" (red badge)
     - Should NOT see attendance form
     - Cannot mark attendance

## Browser Testing
Test the system in different browsers:

## Mobile Testing
Test the responsive design on mobile devices to ensure the attendance form works properly on smaller screens.

## Expected Behavior Summary

| Admin Action | Student View | Student Can Mark |
|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| Opens Attendance | Shows form with buttons | ✅ Yes |
| Closes Attendance | Hides form, shows closed message | ❌ No |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Attendance form not showing:** Check if localStorage has 'attendanceOpen' set to 'true'
2. **Cannot mark attendance:** Verify you're logged in as a student and attendance is open
3. **Status not updating:** Refresh the page to see latest status changes

### Debug Commands:
Open browser console and run:
```javascript
// Check attendance status
console.log('Attendance Open:', localStorage.getItem('attendanceOpen'));

// Check current session
console.log('Current Session:', localStorage.getItem('currentSession'));

// View all attendance records
console.log('Attendance Records:', JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('attendance') || '[]'));
```

## Success Criteria
The attendance system is working correctly when:
1. ✅ Admin can open/close attendance
2. ✅ Students see correct status (open/closed)
3. ✅ Students can mark attendance only when open
4. ✅ Students cannot mark attendance when closed
5. ✅ Attendance records are properly stored and displayed
6. ✅ No duplicate attendance records for same session
