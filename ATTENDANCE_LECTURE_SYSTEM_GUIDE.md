# Attendance Token & Lecture System Guide

## Overview

This system implements a comprehensive attendance and lecture management system with token-based access control, ensuring students must attend before accessing lectures and complete feedback forms.

## Key Features

### 1. Attendance Token System
- **Daily Token Generation**: Admins generate unique tokens for each day
- **One-Time Use**: Each student can only use a token once per day
- **Automatic Expiration**: Tokens expire at midnight
- **Token Validation**: Secure token validation with usage tracking

### 2. Lecture Access Control
- **Attendance Required**: Students must attend before accessing lectures
- **Date-Based Access**: Students can only see lectures from today and previous days
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Admins have full access, students have restricted access

### 3. Feedback System
- **Daily Feedback**: Students must complete daily feedback before accessing lectures
- **Final Feedback**: Required when training is finished
- **Automatic Prompts**: System automatically shows feedback forms when required

## System Flow

### For Administrators

1. **Start Daily Session**:
   - Go to Admin Dashboard â†’ Attendance section
   - Click "Generate Token" to create a new attendance token
   - Share the token with students

2. **Monitor Attendance**:
   - View real-time attendance status
   - See how many students have used the token
   - Track attendance records

3. **Finish Session**:
   - Click "Finish Attendance" when session is complete
   - This prevents further attendance marking
   - Students can still access lectures they've already unlocked

4. **Manage Lectures**:
   - Create lectures with categories, content, and dates
   - Students can only access lectures after attending
   - Lectures are filtered by date and category

### For Students

1. **Mark Attendance**:
   - Go to attendance.html or use the attendance tab
   - Enter the token provided by the instructor
   - Token is validated and marked as used
   - Attendance record is created

2. **Complete Feedback** (if required):
   - System checks if daily feedback is needed
   - If required, feedback form appears automatically
   - Must complete feedback before accessing lectures

3. **Access Lectures**:
   - After attending and completing feedback, lectures become available
   - Can view lectures from today and previous days
   - Lectures are organized by category and date

4. **Training Completion**:
   - When training ends, final feedback is required
   - After submitting final feedback, redirected to completion page
   - Can still access dashboard for review
